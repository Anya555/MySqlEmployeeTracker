# MySqlEmployeeTracker

For this assignment I created an interface also known as CMS, that allows user to view and interact with information stored in databases. Employee tracker is a command line aplication built on these main technologies:

* Node JS
* MySql - allows to connect to  MySQL database and perform queries
* InquirerJS -  allows to interact with the user via the command-line
* Console.table - allows to display arrays and objects in the console in a nice tabular format

Application lets user do the following: 

* Add departments, roles, employees

* View departments, roles, employees

* Update employee roles

My biggest challenge was to learn how to properly join multiple tables. Joins allow you to link data from two or more tables together a single query result--from one single SELECT statement.
